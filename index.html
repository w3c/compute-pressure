  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Modern applications often need to balance the trade offs and advantages of fully utilizing
    the system CPU resources, in order to provide a modern and improved user experience. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, many applications can render video effects with varying degrees of sophistication.
    These applications aim to provide the best user experience, while avoiding driving the user's
    device in a high CPU utilization regime.
  </p>
  <p>
    High CPU utilization is undesirable because it strongly degrades the user experience. Many
    smartphones, tablets and laptops can become uncomfortably hot to the touch. The fans in laptops
    and desktops can become so loud that they disrupt conversations or the users’ ability to focus.
    In many cases, a device under high CPU utilization appears to be unresponsive, as the operating
    system may fail to schedule the threads advancing the task that the user is waiting for. See also

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  <p>
    This specification defines the following concepts:
  </p>
  <section>
    <h3><dfn>CPU utilization</dfn></h3>
    <p>
      The CPU utilization of the user's device is the average of the utilization of all the device's
      CPU cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      A CPU core's utilization is the fraction of time that the core has been executing code belonging
      to a thread, as opposed to being in an idle state.
    </p>
    <p>
      A CPU utilization close to 1.0 is very likely to lead to a bad user experience. The device is
      likely at its thermal limits, and noise from CPU cooling fans is very notisable. Applications
      can help avoid bad user experiences by reducing their compute demands when the CPU utilization
      is high.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3><dfn>CPU clock speed</dfn></h3>
    <p>
      Modern CPU cores support a set of clock speeds. The device's firmware or operating system can
      set the core clock speed, in order to trade off the available CPU computational resources with
      power consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a user experience standpoint, the following are the most interesting clock speed levels:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The minimum clock speed results in the lowest power consumption.
        </li>
        <li>
          The base clock speed results in the power consumption that the CPU is rated for.
          Marketing materials emphasize this speed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The maximum clock speed (also known as "Turbo boost" on certain CPUs) causes unsustainable
          amounts of heatingi continuously running. It can be used for short periods of
          time, to satisfy bursts in demand for CPU compute.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When a device's CPU utilization gets high, the device increases clock speeds across its CPU cores,
      in an attempt to meet the CPU compute demand. As the speeds exceed the base clock speed, the
      elevated power consumption increases the CPU's temperature. At some point, the device enters a
      thermal throttling regime, where the CPU clock speed is reduced, in order to bring the temperature
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time thermal throttling kicks in, the user is having a bad experience. Applications can
      help avoid thermal throttling by reducing their demands for CPU compute right as the CPU clock
      speeds approaches / exceeds the base speed.
    </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section> <h2>Compute Pressure Observer</h2>
The Compute Pressure Observer API enables developers to understand the utilization characteristics of a CPU.

<section data-dfn-for="ComputePressureObserverCallback">
  <h3>The <a>ComputePressureUpdateCallback</a> callback</h3>
  <pre class="idl">
    callback ComputePressureUpdateCallback = undefined (
      ComputePressureObserverUpdate update,
      ComputePressureObserver observer
    );
  </pre>
  This callback will be invoked when <a>CPU clock speed</a> and/or <a>CPU utilization</a> crosses the user
  set thresholds.
</section>

<section  data-dfn-for="ComputePressureObserver"> <h2>The <a>ComputePressureObserver</a> object</h2>
  <p>
    The {{ComputePressureObserver}} can be used to observe changes in the <a>CPU clock speed</a> and
      <a>CPU utilization</a>, following user set thresholds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Providing a list of thresholds effectively separates the resource usage into buckets. For example,
    the thresholds list `[0.5, 0.75, 0.9]` defines a 4-bucket scheme, where the buckets cover the ranges
    `[0-0.5[`, `[0.5-0.75[`, `[0.75-0.9[`, and `[0.9-1.0]`.
  </p>
  <aside class="note">
    <p>
      The user of the API can request an arbitary number of thresholds, but the User Agent may choose to
      observe only a subset of those requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is recommended that user agents allow at most 5 buckets (4 thresholds) for CPU utilization, and
      2 buckets (1 threshold) for CPU speed.
    </p>
  </aside>
