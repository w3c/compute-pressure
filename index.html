  <p>
    The <cite>Compute Pressure API</cite> provides a way for websites to react to changes
    in the CPU pressure of the target device, such that websites can trade off
    resources for an improved user experience.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Modern applications often need to balance the trade offs and advantages of fully utilizing
    the system's computing resources, in order to provide a modern and delightful user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, many applications can render video effects with varying degrees of sophistication.
    These applications aim to provide the best user experience, while avoiding driving the user's
    device into a high pressure regime.
  </p>
  <p>
    Utilization of [=processing units=] close to and often reaching 100% can lead to a bad
    user experience, as different tasks are fighting for the processing time.
    This can lead to slowless, which is especially noticeable with input delay.

    Further, a prolonged utilization close 100% can cause the [=processing units=] to heat up due to prolonged
    boosting, which can lead to throttling, resulting in an even worse user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a result of thermal limits, many smartphones, tablets and laptops can become uncomfortably hot
    to the touch. The fans in laptops and desktops can become so loud that they disrupt conversations
    or the users’ ability to focus.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many cases, a device under high pressure appears to be unresponsive, as the operating
    system may fail to schedule the threads advancing the task that the user is waiting for. See also

  <h2>A Note on Feature Detection</h2>
  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>
    Feature detection is an established web development best practice. Resources on the topic are plentiful on- and
    offline and the purpose of this section is not to discuss it further, but rather to put it in the context of
    detecting hardware-dependent features.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider the below feature detection examples:
  </p>
  <aside class="example" title="Checking existence of PressureObserver interface">
    <p>
      This simple example illustrates how to check whether the [=User Agent=] exposes the
      {{PressureObserver}} interface
    </p>
    <pre class="js">
      if ("PressureObserver" in globalThis) {
        // Use PressureObserver interface
      }
    </pre>
  </aside>
  <aside class="note">
    <p>
      Checking against {{globalThis/globalThis}} will work on any [=ECMAScript/agent=] as defined by
      [[ECMAScript]], thus also in workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does however not tell you whether that API is actually connected to a
      real [=platform collector=], whether the [=platform collector=] is collecting real telemetry
      readings, or whether the user is going to allow you to access it.
    </p>
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  <p>
    This specification defines the following concepts:
  </p>
  <section>
    <h3>Processing Units</h3>
    <p>
      Computing devices consist of a multitude of different <dfn>processing units</dfn> such as the Central
      Processing Unit (CPU), the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and many specialized
      processing units. The latter are becoming popular such as ones designed to accelerate specific
      tasks like machine learning or computer vision.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Pressure sources</h3>
    <p>
      The specification currently defines the <dfn>valid source types</dfn> as
      <span class="experimental"><em>global system thermals</em> and </span>
      the <em>central [=processing unit=]</em>, also known as the CPU.
      Future levels of this specification MAY introduce additional [=source types=].
    </p>
    <pre class="non-experimental idl">
      enum PressureSource { "cpu" };
    </pre>
    <pre class="experimental idl">
      enum PressureSource { "cpu", "thermals" };
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <dfn>PressureSource</dfn> enum represents the [=valid source types=]:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul class="pressure-source">
        <li class="experimental">
          {{PressureSource/"thermals"}} represents the global thermal state of the system.
          <aside class="issue" data-number="294">
            <p>
              The thermal pressure source is at-risk given implementation difficulties.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          {{PressureSource/"cpu"}} represents the average pressure of the central [=processing unit=]
          across all its cores.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <aside class="note">
      <p>
        If a user calls {{PressureObserver/observe()}} with a [=source type=] not part of
        {{PressureSource}}, at the level of this specification the [=user agent=] supports,
        the method will throw a {{TypeError}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the [=source type=] is known by the [=user agent=] (part of {{PressureSource}}),
        but not supported by it, the host OS or the underlying hardware, the method will instead
        throw {{NotSupportedError}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        To list the known [=source types=], a user can call the static attribute
        {{PressureObserver/knownSources}}.
      </p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Sampling and Reporting Rate</h3>
    <p>
      The <dfn>requested sampling interval</dfn> represents the desired
      interval between samples to be obtained from the hardware,
      expressed in milliseconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interval and frequency are inverses of each other, so the
      [=requested sampling interval=] can also be expressed as a
      <dfn>requested sampling rate</dfn> in Hertz (cycles per second) by
      dividing 1000 by the [=requested sampling interval=] value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <dfn>sampling rate</dfn> for a [=platform collector=] is defined as a rate
      at which the [=user agent=] obtains telemetry readings from the underlying platform,
      and it might differ from the pressure observers' [=requested sampling rates=].
      The rate is measured in Hertz (cycles per second).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <dfn>reporting rate</dfn> for a pressure observer is the rate at which it runs
      the [=data collection=] steps, and it will never exceed the [=sampling rate=].
    </p>
    <p>
      The [=sampling rate=] differs from the [=requested sampling rate=] when the
      [=requested sampling rate=] exceeds upper or lower sampling rate bounds
      supported or accepted by the underlying platform and [=user agent=]<sup>†</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <sup>†</sup>The specification additionally obfuscates the rate as outlined
      in [[[#rate-obfuscation]]].
    </p>
    <p>
      In case the user didn't request a [=sampling rate=], the [=sampling rate=]
      is [=implementation-defined=].
    </p>
    <aside class="note">
      In case there are multiple instances of {{PressureObserver}} active with different
      [=requested sampling intervals=], it is up to the [=user agent=] to set a
      [=platform collector=] level [=sampling rate=] that best fulfills these requests,
      while making sure that the [=reporting rate=] of all {{PressureObserver}}s does
      not exceed their respective [=requested sampling rates=].
    </aside>
  </section>
</section>

<section> <h2>Platform primitives</h2>
  <p>
    A <dfn>pressure source</dfn> is an abstract, [=implementation-defined=]
    interface to hardware counters or an underlying framework that provides
    telemetry data about a <dfn>source type</dfn>
    defined by {{PressureSource}}. A [=pressure source=] can make use of data
    fusion with data from additional sources if that provides more precise
    results.
  </p>
  <p>
    The telemetry data provided by a [=pressure source=] is represented in this
    specification as a <dfn>pressure source sample</dfn>, a [=struct=]
    consisting of the following [=struct/items=]:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dfn data-dfn-for="pressure source sample">data</dfn>: [=contributing
        factors=] obtained from the underlying hardware or operating system or,
        in the case of a [=virtual pressure source=], a {{PressureState}} 
        <span class="experimental">and an {{PressureRecord/ownContributionEstimate}} value</span>.
    </li>
      <li>
        <dfn data-dfn-for="pressure source sample">timestamp</dfn>: the
        [=unsafe shared current time=] when [=pressure source sample/data=] was
        obtained.
        <aside class="note">
          <p>
            The purpose of [=pressure source sample/timestamp=] is to use the
            same [=monotonic clock/unsafe current time=] for a sample across
            all globals and invocations of the [=data collection=] algorithm
            which are processing the same [=pressure source sample=].
          </p>
        </aside>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    A [=pressure source=] has an associated <dfn
    data-dfn-for="pressure source">latest sample</dfn>, a [=pressure source
    sample=] or null. It is initially null.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <dfn>platform collector</dfn> is an abstract interface responsible for
    obtaining telemetry samples from a [=pressure source=], transforming them
    into [=pressure states=] and providing them to the [=user agent=].
  </p>
  <p>
    A [=platform collector=] has the following associated data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      an <dfn data-dfn-for="platform collector">associated pressure
      source</dfn>, which is a [=pressure source=] or null.
    </li>
    <li>
      an <dfn data-dfn-for="platform collector">activated</dfn> boolean,
      initially false.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The format of the telemetry data provided by a [=pressure source=]
    and stored in its [=pressure source/latest sample=]'s [=pressure source
    sample/data=] is [=implementation-defined=], and so is the process through
    which a [=platform collector=] transforms it into a [=pressure state=].
  </p>
  <p>
    For this specification's purposes, [=platform collectors=] are scoped to a
    [=global object=] via the [=platform collector mapping=].
  </p>
  <p>
    For automation purposes, a [=platform collector=] must have the ability to
    connect to [=virtual pressure sources=] and use their simulated [=pressure
    source sample/data=] as [=pressure states=] rather than raw platform data
    that must be transformed into an [=adjusted pressure state=].
  </p>
  <p>
    As collecting telemetry data often means polling hardware counters, it is not a free operation and thus,
    it should not happen if there are no one observing the data. See [[[#life-cycle]]] for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    A [=platform collector=] samples data at a specific rate. A [=user agent=] may modify this rate
    (if possible) for privacy reasons, or ignore and fuse certain readings.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>
    User notifications
  </h3>
  <p>
    It is RECOMMENDED that a [=user agent=] show some form of user-visible
    notification that informs the user when a pressure observer is active,
    as well as provides the user with the means to block the ongoing operation,
    or simply dismiss the notification.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>
    Policy control
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Compute Pressure API defines a [=policy-controlled feature=]
    identified by the token "compute-pressure".
    Its [=policy-controlled feature/default allowlist=] is `'self'`.
  </p>
  <p>
    Workers (dedicated and shared) adhere to the permission policy set by their
    owning document(s).
  </p>
  <p>
    Shared workers often have multiple owning documents as they can be obtained
    by other documents with the [=same origin=].

    In this case, all owning documents must be [=allowed to use=] the [=policy-controlled
    feature=] defined by this specification.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dedicated workers can be created from other workers,
    in which case the permission policy of the first owning document
    (or owning documents, in case of a shared worker) up the owner
    chain will be used.
  </p>
  <aside class="note">
    There has been discussion on allowing setting permission policy directly
    on a worker on creation, in which case that would have to be consulted
    as well.
  </aside>
  <aside class="note">
    <p>
      The [=policy-controlled feature/default allowlist=] of `'self'` allows usage in
      same-origin nested frames but prevents third-party content from using
      the feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third-party usage can be selectively enabled by adding
      `allow="compute-pressure"` attribute to the frame container element:
    </p>
    <pre class="example html" title=
    "Enabling compute pressure on remote content">
      &lt;iframe src="https://third-party.com" allow="compute-pressure"/&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Alternatively, the Compute Pressure API can be disabled completely by
      specifying the permissions policy in a HTTP response header:
    </p>
    <pre class="example http" title="Feature Policy over HTTP">
      Permissions-Policy: {"compute-pressure": []}
    </pre>
    <p>
      See [[[PERMISSIONS-POLICY]]] for more details.
    </p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>
    Internal Slot Definitions
  </h3>
  <p>
    Each [=global object=] has:
    <ul>
      <li>
        a <dfn>pressure observer task queued</dfn> (a boolean), which is initially false.
      </li>
      <li>
        a <dfn>registered observer list</dfn> per supported [=source type=], which is initially empty.
      </li>
      <li>
        a <dfn>platform collector mapping</dfn>, an [=ordered map=] of [=source
        types=] to [=platform collectors=].
      </li>
    </ul>
    A <dfn>registered observer</dfn> consists of an <dfn>observer</dfn> (a {{PressureObserver}} object).
  </p>
  <p>
    The [=user agent=] has:
    <ul>
      <li>
        a <dfn>max queued records</dfn> integer, which is set to an [=implementation-defined=] value, greater than 0.
      </li>
      <li>
        a <dfn>supported source types</dfn> [=list=] of [=implementation-defined=] {{PressureSource}} values.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    A constructed {{PressureObserver}} object has the following internal slots:
  </p>
  <ul data-dfn-for="PressureObserver">
    <li>
      a <dfn>[[\Callback]]</dfn> of type {{PressureUpdateCallback}} set on creation.
    </li>
    <li>
      a <dfn>[[\PendingObservePromises]]</dfn> [=list=] of zero or more source-promise [=tuples=], initially empty,
      where source holds a {{PressureSource}} string and promise holds a {{Promise}} object.
    </li>
    <li>
      a <dfn>[[\QueuedRecords]]</dfn> [=queue=] of zero or more {{PressureRecord}}
      objects, which is initially empty.
    </li>
    <li>
      a <dfn>[[\LastRecordMap]]</dfn> [=ordered map=] of {{PressureSource}} to
      the latest {{PressureRecord}}.
    </li>
    <li>
      a <dfn>[[\SampleIntervalMap]]</dfn> [=ordered map=] of {{PressureSource}} to
      positive numbers. It represents the sample interval given source type.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For the [=rate obfuscation=] mitigation the constructed {{PressureObserver}} object additionally
    has the following internal slots:
  </p>
  <ul data-dfn-for="PressureObserver">
    <li>
      an <dfn>[[\ObservationWindow]]</dfn> integer set as part of the [=reset observation window=] steps.
    </li>
    <li>
      a <dfn>[[\MaxChangesThreshold]]</dfn> integer set as part of the [=reset observation window=] steps.
    </li>
    <li>
      a <dfn>[[\PenaltyDuration]]</dfn> integer set as part of the [=reset observation window=] steps.
    </li>
    <li>
      a <dfn>[[\ChangesCountMap]]</dfn> [=ordered map=], [=map/keyed=] on a {{PressureSource}},
      representing the [=source type=] that triggered transition to the current [=pressure state=].
      The [=ordered map=]'s [=map/value=] is an integer representing the number of state changes in the
      current observation window timeframe.
    </li>
    <li>
      a <dfn>[[\AfterPenaltyRecordMap]]</dfn> [=ordered map=], [=map/keyed=] on a {{PressureSource}},
      representing the [=source type=] of the last {{PressureRecord}}.
      The [=ordered map=]'s [=map/value=] is a {{PressureRecord}}.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section> <h2>Pressure States</h2>
  <p>
    <dfn>Pressure states</dfn> represents the minimal set of useful states that allows websites
    to react to changes in compute and system pressure with minimal degration in quality or service,
    or user experience.
  </p>
  <pre class="idl">
    enum PressureState { "nominal", "fair", "serious", "critical" };
  </pre>
  <p>
    The <dfn>PressureState</dfn> enum represents the [=pressure state=] with the following states:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul class="pressure-states">
      <li>
        {{PressureState/"nominal"}}: The conditions of the target device are at an acceptable level with no noticeable
        adverse effects on the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        {{PressureState/"fair"}}: Target device pressure, temperature and/or energy usage are slightly elevated, potentially
        resulting in reduced battery-life, as well as fans (or systems with fans) becoming active and audible.
        Apart from that the target device is running flawlessly and can take on additional work.
      </li>
      <li>
        {{PressureState/"serious"}}: Target device pressure, temperature and/or energy usage is consistently highly elevated.
        The system may be throttling as a countermeasure to reduce thermals.
      </li>
      <li>
        {{PressureState/"critical"}}: The temperature of the target device or system is significantly elevated and it requires
        cooling down to avoid any potential issues.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</section>

<section> <h2>Contributing Factors</h2>
  <p>
    <dfn>Contributing factors</dfn> represent the underlying hardware metrics contributing to the current [=pressure state=]
    and can be [=implementation-defined=].
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>adjusted pressure state</dfn> is a [=pressure state=] determined by an [=implementation-defined=]
    algorithm that takes as input [=source type=] and any other [=implementation-defined=] data from
    [=contributing factors=]. This algorithm MUST not be deterministic to ensure [=break calibration=] mitigation effectiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>change in contributing factors is substantial</dfn> steps are as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>
        If [=implementation-defined=] low-level hardware metrics that contribute to the
        current [=pressure state=] drop below or exceed an, per metric,
        [=implementation-defined=] threshold
        for the current [=pressure state=], return true.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return false.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="note">
      <p>
        The [=change in contributing factors is substantial=] algorithm allows [=user agents=] to avoid flip-
        flopping between states in certain circumstances. For example, a state might otherwise change too rapidly
        in response to a certain system metric that fluctuates around a boundary condition that triggers a state
        change.
     </p>
      <p>
        This specification does not define the precise algorithm
        to allow implementations optimize this algorithm to match the underlying hardware platform's behavior.
        One possible implementation of this algorithm is to use a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preisach_model_of_hysteresis#Nonideal_relay">nonideal relay</a>

    Security and privacy considerations
  </h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Types of privacy and security threats</h3>
    <div class="note">
      The Working Group will list any known attack vectors, both theoretical and real-world,
      in this section.
    </div>
    <h4>Timing attacks</h4>
    <p>
      It may be possible to identify users across non-[=same origin=] sites if unique
      or very precise values can be accessed at the same time by sites not sharing
      origin.

      This attack is mitigated by [[[#data-minimization]]], [[[#rate-obfuscation]]],
      and [[[#same-origin-restriction]]].
    </p>
    <h4>Cross-site covert channel</h4>
    <p>
      In computer security a covert channel creates a capability to transfer information between processes
      that are not supposed to be allowed to communicate. In modern multi-process web engines in the generic
      case each window or tab resides in its own process (documents that have the [=same origin=] or sites that
      have the [=same site=] typically share the same process). Using this API it may be possible to create a
      cross-site covert channel C where a site A on one tab first broadcasts to the channel C after having
      manipulated the state of the CPU. Next a site B (that is not same site with site A) on another tab reads
      the broadcasted data from the channel C by using this API to learn when the state of the CPU has changed.
      This process is repeated as long as the scripts run on both the sites A and B.
    </p>
    <p>
      This attack is mitigated by [[[#rate-obfuscation]]] and [[[#break-calibration]]].
      Implementers are advised to consider all these mitigations for long-running scripts.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      The longer the scripts run the more information can be transmitted using the proposed cross-site covert channel.
      For example, if a user is on a video conferencing site and another long-running site that allows for more
      information to be transferred compared to a regular browsing scenario. On the other hand, a workload such as
      a video conferencing session will typically exert sustained pressure on the CPU that makes it harder to
      manipulate the pressure state in a predictive manner.
    </div>
    <h4>Targeted de-anonymization attacks</h4>
    <p>
      Targeted de-anonymization attacks constitute a critical class of threats that jeopardize a user's anonymity.
      These attacks allow a malicious or partially compromised website (referred to as the “malicious site”) to
      ascertain whether a website visitor possesses a specific public identifier, such as an email address or a
      social media handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      While anonymity may be a luxury for some, for certain individuals, it is far more than that—it is a matter
      of survival. Consider for instance those who engage in political protests, work as journalists covering
      sensitive topics, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, an attacker can privately share a resource with the target for instance using a public
      resource sharing service (“victim site”), and then measure side-effects (indicating successful access)
      on loading the resource via side-channels. If the logged in visitor can access the embedded resource
      successfully, that indicates that the current visit is indeed the intended target.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, exposing reliable information about the total CPU pressure can let an attacking site
      understand if a target of a cross-origin navigation (e.g. an iframe or pop-up window from another site)
      performed a CPU-intensive operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_ad#Pop-under_ads">pop-under</a> and
      <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22-zaheri.pdf">tab-under</a> can be used to hide the loading
      from the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      One possible attack is that the malicious website opens e.g., a popup to a resource on a victim site
      to which the user is logged in (e.g. a video streaming site or online document editor) pointing to a
      resource shared with specific users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming that loading the resource puts increased pressure on the CPU, this would create a side-channel
      reveals to the attacking site if the user is logged into an account with access to the resource,
      deanonymizing the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that modern CPUs recover quickly from high pressure, one possible mitigation strategy could be to
      temporarily disable readings for a few seconds after loading popup and iframe content.
    </p>

    <h3>Mitigation strategies</h3>

    <div class="note">
      This section gives a high-level view into mitigation strategies applicable to this specification.
      The normative definitions of these mitigations are integrated into the respective algorithms of this specification.
      Implementers are advised to consider the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/private-browsing-modes/#features-supporting-private-browsing">TAG guidance
      on private browsing modes</a> when implementing the mitigations defined in this specification.
    </div>

    <h4>Data minimization</h4>
    <p>
      This specification adheres to the generic
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/#data-minimization">data minimization</a> principles
      to limit exposure of data related to low-level details of the underlying platform to the minimum required to
      address its high-value use cases. This includes consideration for limiting exposure of
      <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#device-ids">identifying information about devices</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specific application of data minimization principles in the context of this specification
      are discussed in [[[#rate-obfuscation]]] and [[[#same-origin-restriction]]].
      <section>
        <h4>Rate obfuscation</h4>
        <p>
          The specification requires implementing the <dfn>rate obfuscation</dfn> mitigation
          to keep track of the number of pressure changes over an [=implementation-defined=]
          sliding observation window and
          set a flag if an [=implementation-defined=] threshold for the number of pressure
          changes is exceeded. Similarly, it is also recommended for the implementation to
          observe any abnormal activity such as a high number of pressure state changes
          spanning across multiple states, and set this flag similarly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this flag is set, the implementation is recommended to give the pressure observer
          a penalty during which it will not be able to inform scripts of changes in its
          pressure state as it normally would. The duration of this penalty is
          [=implementation-defined=] and it is recommended to be randomized.
          When [=notify pressure observers=] resumes operation after the penalty, it only
          reports the latest pressure state and disregards any interim state information
          received from the platform collector during this penalty.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Rate obfuscation normative parameters</h4>
        <p>
          Based on implementation experience, implementers must use:
          <ul>
            <li>
              a range in between 50 and 100 changes for PressureObserver's {{PressureObserver/[[MaxChangesThreshold]]}} internal slot.
            </li>
            <li>
              a range in between 5000 milliseconds and 10000 milliseconds for PressureObserver's {{PressureObserver/[[PenaltyDuration]]}} internal slot.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="note">
            These values are subject to change and are updated based on further implementation experience and research findings.

      <h4>Rate obfuscation non-normative parameters</h4>
        <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
        <p>
          Based on implementation experience, implementers are advised to use:
          <ul>
            <li>
              a range in between 300000 milliseconds (5 minutes) and 600000 milliseconds (10 minutes) for PressureObserver's
              {{PressureObserver/[[ObservationWindow]]}} internal slot.
            </li>
          </ul>

          </aside>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Break calibration</h4>
        <p>
          In a calibration process an attacker tries to manipulate the CPU so that this
          API would report a transition into a certain pressure state with the highest
          probability in response to the pressure exerted by the fabricated workload.
          This <dfn>break calibration</dfn> mitigation solution can slow down or prevent this calibration process
          from succeeding by slightly changing at runtime the [=implementation-defined=]
          low-level hardware metrics that contribute to these pressure state transitions.
          Even if the initial calibration would succeed, its results will be invalidated
          at runtime when this mitigation is running continuously. Any attempts to recalibrate
          will similarly be mitigated against.
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
          Modern browsers throttle background tabs using [=implementation-defined=]
          heuristics in order to reduce resource usage. For example, after a period of
          no user interaction a background tab can be throttled that will influence
          the global pressure state of the system. This built-in feature of modern
          browsers further improves the effectiveness of the break calibration
          mitigation.

      <section>
        <h4>Break calibration parameters</h4>
        <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
        <p>
          Based on implementation experience, implementers are advised to apply the mitigation
          to a randomized time value within a range between 120000 milliseconds (2 minutes) and 240000 milliseconds (4 minutes).

  <h2>
    Accessibility considerations
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Compute Pressure API is focused on improving the user experience. There are two ways in which applications that build on the API can positively impact accessibility.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Considering users' access needs when making decisions based on information gathered using the API.
    </li>
    <li>
      Designing and making user interfaces based on information gained from the API with accessibility in mind.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    As a consumer of the API, it's important to consider both of these opportunities. Here are some examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Decision:</strong> In a video conferencing scenario, there may be multiple video streams. The system may determines that it needs to drop certain streams in order to conserve resources. If one of the video streams comes from a sign language interpreter, then that stream must be prioritized over others, so that the user can still understand the conversation. In practice, this could be simply implemented by allowing the user to "pin" a certain stream, and ensuring that that pinned stream is never automatically dropped by the system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User Interface:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A simple load-level meter, in which the current usage level bucket is indicated on the screen. This information must be conveyed using more than just color, so that people who cannot perceive color can still perceive the information. A symbol could be used in conjunction with color. Text could also be used in conjunction with both shape and color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some applications may present a notification to the user when some functionality is restricted due to compute pressure. These notifications may take the form of "toast" messages, in which case care must be taken to ensure that people using assistive technologies (including screen readers) can be made aware of the notification, and dismiss it, without unduly interrupting their workflow.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>
    Automation
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Compute Pressure API poses a challenge to test authors, as fully
    exercising interface requires physical hardware devices that respond in
    predictable ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    To address this challenge this document defines a [[!WEBDRIVER2]] [=extension
    commands=] that allows defining and controlling virtual pressure sources that behave
    like real ones and which can have particular properties and whose readings can be
    entirely defined by users.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Virtual Pressure Source
  </h2>
  <p>
    A <dfn>virtual pressure source</dfn> is a [=pressure source=] that
    simulates the behavior of a real one in controlled ways. It reports
    pressure changes to zero or more [=platform collectors=] connected to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contrary to a real [=pressure source=], however, it reports [=pressure
    state=] values directly instead of [=implementation-defined=] values that
    must be processed into [=pressure states=] by a [=platform collector=]. In
    other words, a [=virtual pressure source=]'s [=pressure source sample=]'s
    [=pressure source sample/data=] is a {{PressureState}}.
  </p>
  <p class="experimental">
  [=virtual pressure source=] also reports {{PressureRecord/ownContributionEstimate}}.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the data associated with all [=pressure sources=] (such as
    [=pressure source sample=]), each [=virtual pressure source=] has:
    <ul>
      <li>
        a <dfn data-dfn-for="virtual pressure source">can provide samples
        </dfn> boolean.
      </li>
      <li>
        a <dfn data-dfn-for="virtual pressure source">connected platform
        collectors</dfn> [=set=] of [=platform collectors=].
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Each [=top-level traversable=] has a <dfn>virtual pressure source mapping</dfn>, which is an [=ordered map=] of
    [=source types=] to [=virtual pressure source=].
  </p>
  <aside class="note">
    <p>
      As currently specified, the [[!WEBDRIVER2]] integration and the
      [=extension commands=] below do <em>not</em> have an effect on shared
      workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developer feedback and use cases for shared worker support are welcome
      via GitHub issues.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <aside class="note">
    <p>
      As currently specified, [=virtual pressure sources=] only have an effect
      on a {{Window}} or {{DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope}} when its [=platform
      collector mapping=] does not have an entry for the [=source type=] the
      [=virtual pressure source=] represents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, creating a virtual pressure source for a [=source type=]
      for which {{PressureObserver/observe()}} has already been called will not
      affect any existing instances until either
      {{PressureObserver/disconnect()}} or {{PressureObserver/unobserve()}} has
      been called on them. New instances will only make use of the new
      [=virtual pressure source=] if {{PressureObserver/observe()}} is called
      after existing observers have been disconnected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, if a [=virtual pressure source=] is in use by one or more
      {{PressureObserver}} instances and it is removed, all instances must stop
      observation before calls to {{PressureObserver/observe()}} attempt to
      connect to a real [=pressure source=].

  <pre class="example js" title="How to access observer from callback" id="cb-observer-example">
    const samples = [];

    function pressureChange(records, observer) {
      for (const record of records) {
        samples.push(record.state);

        // We only want 20 samples.
        if (samples.length == 20) {
          observer.disconnect();
          return;
        }
      }
    }

    const observer = new PressureObserver(pressureChange);
    observer.observe("cpu");
  </pre>
  <p>
    In the following example we want to lower the number of concurrent video streams when the
    pressure becomes critical. For the sake of simplicity we only consider this one state.
  </p>
  <p>
    As lowering the amount of streams might not result in exiting the critical state,
    or at least not immediately, we use a strategy where we lower one stream at the time
    every 30 seconds while still in the critical state.
  </p>
  <p>
    We accomplish this by making sure the callback is called at least once every 30 seconds,
    or when the state actually changes. When the state changes we reset the interval timer.
  </p>
  <pre class="example js" title="How to adjust the number of video feeds based on CPU pressure">
    let timerId = -1;
    function pressureChange(records) {
      // Clear timer every time we are called, either by an actual state change,
      // or when called by setTimeout (see below).
      if (timerId > 0) {
        clearTimeout(timerId);
      }

      // When entering critical state, we want to recheck every 30sec if we are
      // still in critical state and if so, further reduce our concurrent streams.
      // For this reason we create a timer for 30 seconds that will call us back
      // with the last result in there were no change.
      const lastRecordArray = [records.at(records.length - 1)];
      timerId = setTimeout(pressureChange.bind(this, lastRecordArray), 30_000);

      for (const record of records) {
        if (record.state == "critical") {
          let streamsCount = getStreamsCount();
          setStreamsCount(streamsCount--);
        }
      }
    }

    const observer = new PressureObserver(pressureChange);
    observer.observe("cpu");
  </pre>
  <p>
    In the following example, we want to demonstrate the usage of {{PressureObserver/takeRecords()}},
    by retrieving the remaining |records| accumulated since the the callback was last
    invoked.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is recommended to do so before {{PressureObserver/disconnect()}},
    otherwise {{PressureObserver/disconnect()}} will clear them and they will be lost forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, we might want to measure the pressure during a benchmarking workload, and thus
    want pressure telemetry for the exact duration of the workload. This means disconnecting all
    observers immediately when the task is completed, and manually requesting any pending pressure
    telemetry up to this point that might not have been delivered yet as part of the event loop cycle.
  </p>
  <pre class="example js" title="How to handle all state changes right up until disconnect">
    function logWorkloadStatistics(records) {
      // do something with records.
    }

    const observer = new PressureObserver(logWorkloadStatistics);
    observer.observe("cpu");

    // Read pending state change records, otherwise they will be cleared
    // when we disconnect.
    const records = observer.takeRecords();
    logWorkloadStatistics(records);

    observer.disconnect();
  </pre>
  <p>
    In the following example, we show how to tell the observer to stop watching a specific
    |source:PressureSource| by invoking {{PressureObserver/unobserve()}}
    with |source|.
  </p>
  <aside class="note">
    The example uses 'gpu', which could be a potential future addition to the specification. It aims to show
    that the API is extentable to support other types of pressure in the future
  </aside>
  <pre class="example js" title="How to tell the observer to stop watching for state changes for a specific source">
    const observer = new PressureObserver(records => { /* do something with records. */ });

    observer.observe("cpu");
    observer.observe("gpu");

    // Callback now gets called whenever the pressure state changes for 'cpu' or 'gpu'.

    observer.unobserve("gpu");

    // Callback now only gets called whenever the pressure state changes for 'cpu'.
  </pre>
  <p>
    In the following example, we show how to tell the observer to stop watching for any
    state changes by calling {{PressureObserver/disconnect()}}. Calling
    {{PressureObserver/disconnect()}} will stop observing all sources observed
    by previous {{PressureObserver/observe()}} calls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally it will clear all pending records collected since the last callback was invoked.
