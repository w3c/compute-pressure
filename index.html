  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Modern applications often need to balance the trade offs and advantages of fully utilizing
    the system CPU resources, in order to provide a modern and improved user experience. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, many applications can render video effects with varying degrees of sophistication.
    These applications aim to provide the best user experience, while avoiding driving the user's
    device in a high CPU utilization regime.
  </p>
  <p>
    High CPU utilization is undesirable because it strongly degrades the user experience. Many
    smartphones, tablets and laptops can become uncomfortably hot to the touch. The fans in laptops
    and desktops can become so loud that they disrupt conversations or the users’ ability to focus.
    In many cases, a device under high CPU utilization appears to be unresponsive, as the operating
    system may fail to schedule the threads advancing the task that the user is waiting for. See also

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  <p>
    This specification defines the following concepts:
  </p>
  <section>
    <h3><dfn>CPU utilization</dfn></h3>
    <p>
      The CPU utilization of the user's device is the average of the utilization of all the device's
      CPU cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      A CPU core's utilization is the fraction of time that the core has been executing code belonging
      to a thread, as opposed to being in an idle state.
    </p>
    <p>
      A CPU utilization close to 1.0 is very likely to lead to a bad user experience. The device is
      likely at its thermal limits, and noise from CPU cooling fans is very noticeable. Applications
      can help avoid bad user experiences by reducing their compute demands when the CPU utilization
      is high.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3><dfn>CPU clock speed</dfn></h3>
    <p>
      Modern CPU cores support a set of clock speeds. The device's firmware or operating system can
      set the core clock speed, in order to trade off the available CPU computational resources with
      power consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a user experience standpoint, the following are the most interesting clock speed levels:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The minimum clock speed results in the lowest power consumption.
        </li>
        <li>
          The base clock speed results in the power consumption that the CPU is rated for.
          Marketing materials emphasize this speed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The maximum clock speed (also known as "Turbo boost" on certain CPUs) causes unsustainable
          amounts of heat when continuously running. It can be used for short periods of
          time, to satisfy bursts in demand for CPU compute.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When a device's CPU utilization gets high, the device increases clock speeds across its CPU cores,
      in an attempt to meet the CPU compute demand. As the speeds exceed the base clock speed, the
      elevated power consumption increases the CPU's temperature. At some point, the device enters a
      thermal throttling regime, where the CPU clock speed is reduced, in order to bring the temperature
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time thermal throttling kicks in, the user is having a bad experience. Applications can
      help avoid thermal throttling by reducing their demands for CPU compute right as the CPU clock
      speeds approaches / exceeds the base speed.

  <pre class="idl">
    callback ComputePressureUpdateCallback = undefined (

<section  data-dfn-for="ComputePressureObserver"> <h2>The <a>ComputePressureObserver</a> object</h2>
  <p>
    The {{ComputePressureObserver}} can be used to observe changes in the <a>CPU clock speed</a> and
      <a>CPU utilization</a>, following user set thresholds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Providing a list of thresholds effectively separates the resource usage into buckets. For example,
    the thresholds list `[0.5, 0.75, 0.9]` defines a 4-bucket scheme, where the buckets cover the ranges
    `[0-0.5[`, `[0.5-0.75[`, `[0.75-0.9[`, and `[0.9-1.0]`.

  <aside class="note">
    <p>
      The user of the API can request an arbitary number of thresholds, but the User Agent may choose to
      observe only a subset of those requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is recommended that user agents allow at most 5 buckets (4 thresholds) for CPU utilization, and
      2 buckets (1 threshold) for CPU speed.

    Security and privacy considerations
  </h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Minimizing information exposure</h3>
    <p>
      Exposing hardware related events related to CPU utilization 
      <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#device-ids">
      increases the risk of harming the user's privacy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To minimize this risk, only the absolute minimal
      amount of information needed to to support the use-cases is exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subsections below describe the processing model. At a high level, the
      information exposed is reduced by the following steps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Normalization</b> - Per-core information reported by the operating system is
          normalized to a number between 0.0 and 1.0. This removes variability across
          CPU models and operating systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Aggregation</b> - Normalized per-core information is aggregated into one
          overall number.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Quantization</b> (a.k.a. bucketing) - Each application (origin) must declare
          a small number of value ranges (buckets) where it wants to behave
          differently. The application doesn't receive the exact aggregation results,
          and instead only gets to learn the range (bucket) that each aggregated number
          falls within to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rate-limiting</b> - The user agent notifies the application of changes in
          the information it can learn (buckets that each aggregated number). Change
          notifications are rate-limited.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <section>
        <h4>Normalizing CPU utilization</h4>
        <p>
          The user agent will normalize CPU core utilization information reported by the
          operating system to a number between 0.0 and 1.0.
        </p>
        <p>
          0.0 maps to 0% utilization, meaning the CPU core was always idle during the
          observed time window. 1.0 maps to 100% utilization, meaning the CPU core
          was never idle during the observed time window.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Aggregating CPU utilization</h4>
        <p>
          CPU utilization is averaged over all enabled CPU cores.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under normal circumstances, all of a system's cores are enabled. However,
          mitigating some recent micro-architectural attacks on some devices may require
          completely disabling some CPU cores. For example, some Intel systems require
          disabling hyperthreading.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend that user agents aggregate CPU utilization over a time window of 1
          second. Smaller windows increase the risk of facilitating a side-channel attack.
          Larger windows reduce the application's ability to make timely decisions that
          avoid bad user experiences.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Normalizing CPU clock speed</h4>
        <p>
          This API normalizes each CPU core's clock speed to a number between `0.0` and `1.0`.
          The proposal intends to enable the decisions we set out to support, without
          exposing the clock speeds.
        </p>
        <p>
           We recommend the following principles for normalizing a CPU core's clock speed.
           <ul>
             <li>
              The minimum clock speed is always reported as `0.0`.
             </li>
             <li>
              The base clock speed is always reported as `0.5`.
             </li>
             <li>
              The maximum clock speed is always reported as `1.0`.
             </li>
             <li>
              Speeds outside these values are clamped (to `0.0` or `1.0`).
             </li>
             <li>
              Speeds between these values are linearly interpolated.
             </li>
           </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Aggregating CPU clock speed</h4>
        <p class="issue">
          TODO: Aggregating is an average of the current speed across all cores. No
          aggregation over a time window. Proposal for aggregating clock speeds across
          systems with heterogeneous CPU cores
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Quantizing values (a.k.a. Bucketing)</h4>
        <p>
          Quantizing the aggregated CPU utilization and clock speed reduces the amount of
          information exposed by the API.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having applications designate the quantization ranges (buckets) reduces the
          quantization resolution that user agents must support in order to enable the
          decisions used in a multitude of applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applications communicate their desired quantization scheme by passing in a list
          of thresholds. For example, the thresholds list `[0.5, 0.75, 0.9]` defines a
          4-bucket scheme, where the buckets cover the value ranges `0`-`0.5`, `0.5`-`0.75`,
          `0.75`-`0.9`, and `0.9`-`1.0`. We propose representing a bucket using the middle
          value in its range.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          Suppose an application used the threshold list above, and the user
          agent measured a CPU utilization of `0.87`. This would fall under the `0.75`-`0.9`
          bucket, and would be reported as `0.825` (the average of `0.75` and `0.9`).
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend that user agents allow at most 5 buckets (4 thresholds) for
          CPU utilization, and 2 buckets (1 threshold) for CPU speed.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Rate-limiting change notifications</h4>
        <p>
          We propose exposing the quantized CPU utilization and clock speed via
          rate-limited change notifications. This aims to remove the ability to observe
          the precise time when a value transitions between two buckets.
        </p>
        <p>
          More precisely, once the compute pressure observer is installed, it will be
          called once with initial quantized values, and then be called when the quantized
          values change. The subsequent calls will be rate-limited. When the callback is
          called, the most recent quantized value is reported.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specification will recommend a rate limit of at most one call per second
          for the active window, and one call per 10 seconds for all other windows. We
          will also recommend that the call timings are jittered across origins.
        </p>
        <p>
          These measures benefit the user's privacy, by reducing the risk of
          identifying a device across multiple origins. The rate-limiting also benefits
          the user's security, by making it difficult to use this API for timing attacks.
          Last, rate-limiting change callbacks places an upper bound on the performance
          overhead of this API.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Third-party contexts</h4>
        <p>
          This API will only be available in frames served from the same origin as the
          top-level frame. This requirement is necessary for preserving the privacy
          benefits of the API's quantizing scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same-origin requirement above implies that the API is only available in
          first-party contexts.
